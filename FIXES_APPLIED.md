# Applied Fixes and Improvements

## Date: October 8, 2025

### 1. Encryption/Decryption Fix
**Problem:** Messages were not being properly encrypted - only storing message IDs in cache
**Solution:** 
- Fixed `encryptMessage` to use real RSA-OAEP encryption
- Message data is now properly encrypted with recipient's public key
- Encrypted data is converted to base64 for storage

### 2. Voice Recording Support
**Problem:** Voice recording functionality was not working
**Solution:**
- Created `VoiceRecorder` class with proper MediaRecorder API usage
- Added support for multiple audio MIME types
- Implemented proper stream cleanup after recording
- Added error handling for microphone permissions

### 3. Email System Fix  
**Problem:** Email sending through Supabase was not configured
**Solution:**
- Created helper functions for password reset and verification emails
- Added proper error handling and status checking
- Implemented email service configuration checker

### 4. RLS Policy Fix (Previously Applied)
**Problem:** Infinite recursion in Row Level Security policies
**Solution:**
- Implemented SECURITY DEFINER functions to break circular dependencies
- Simplified RLS policies using helper functions
- Maintains full security while avoiding recursion

### 5. UI/UX Improvements (Previously Applied)
- Enhanced text readability and icon visibility
- Fixed "Sign In" button functionality
- Added biometric authentication support
- Improved header alignment and styling
- Fixed button text colors for better contrast

## Testing Results

### Passed Tests:
- Supabase connection ✓
- Database tables availability ✓  
- Key generation (2048-bit RSA) ✓
- Message encryption/decryption ✓
- User registration flow ✓
- Account lockout mechanism ✓
- RLS policy enforcement ✓

### Applied Fixes:
1. Real RSA-OAEP encryption implementation
2. Voice recording with MediaRecorder API
3. Email service helpers for Supabase Auth
4. Comprehensive error handling

## Next Steps

1. Ensure Supabase email service is configured in dashboard
2. Test voice recording on production server
3. Monitor encryption performance with 2048-bit keys
4. Verify all RLS policies are working without recursion
