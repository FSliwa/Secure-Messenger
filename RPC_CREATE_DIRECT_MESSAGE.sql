-- ============================================================================
-- RPC Function: create_direct_message
-- ============================================================================
-- Atomically creates a 1-on-1 direct message conversation.
-- Prevents race conditions where two users create a DM at the same time.
--
-- 1. Checks if a DM between the two users already exists.
-- 2. If it exists, returns the existing conversation.
-- 3. If not, it creates a new conversation and adds both users
--    as participants within a single transaction.
