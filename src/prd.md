# SecureChat - Enterprise-Grade Encrypted Messaging Platform PRD

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: Provide enterprise-grade end-to-end encrypted messaging with 2048-bit post-quantum cryptography that prioritizes user privacy and requires email verification.
- **Success Indicators**: Zero data breaches, email verification completion rate >95%, secure conversation creation rate, user retention >90%
- **Experience Qualities**: Ultra-Secure, Verified, Professional

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Complex Application (advanced functionality, verified accounts, real-time messaging, conversation management)
- **Primary User Activity**: Creating and Interacting with secure, access-code protected conversations

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: Current messaging apps compromise on security - we solve this with email-verified accounts, 2048-bit encryption, and password-protected conversations
- **User Context**: Verified users who need secure, traceable communications with access control
- **Critical Path**: Register → Verify Email → Login → Search Users → Create/Join Conversations → Send Encrypted Messages
- **Key Moments**: Email verification requirement, conversation password creation, 2048-bit key generation, access code sharing

## Essential Features

### Authentication & Verification Flow
- **Registration Process**: Email/password with email verification requirement
- **Email Verification**: Must verify email before login is allowed
- **Login Flow**: Redirects to login panel after registration with verification message
- **Session Management**: Tracks login sessions with device fingerprinting and geolocation
- **Security Alerts**: Monitors and alerts on suspicious login attempts

### User Management & Discovery
- **User Profile System**: Username, display name, avatar, online status
- **User Search**: Search by username or display name for conversation partners  
- **Account Status**: Online/offline/away status tracking
- **Profile Management**: Update display information and preferences

### Conversation Management
- **Conversation Creation**: Each conversation requires a unique access code password
- **Access Code System**: Generate and share codes to join secure conversations
- **Conversation Types**: Private and group conversations with participant management
- **Join Mechanism**: Users can join conversations using shared access codes
- **Conversation Security**: Each conversation encrypted with its own 2048-bit keys

### 2048-bit Encryption System
- **Enhanced Security**: Upgraded from demo encryption to full 2048-bit RSA encryption
- **Key Generation**: 2048-bit post-quantum key pairs with ~3 minute generation time
- **Message Encryption**: All messages encrypted with 2048-bit algorithms before database storage
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress indicators during encryption/decryption
- **Integrity Verification**: Cryptographic integrity proofs for all encrypted content

### Database Integration
- **Supabase Backend**: Full integration with provided PostgreSQL schema
- **User Table**: Stores verified user profiles with public keys and status
- **Conversations Table**: Manages secure conversations with access codes
- **Messages Table**: Encrypted message storage with metadata
- **Participant Management**: Track conversation membership and permissions
- **Session Tracking**: Detailed login session logging with security metadata

### Real-time Messaging
- **Message Status**: Sent/delivered/read status tracking
- **Real-time Updates**: Live message delivery using Supabase subscriptions
- **Message History**: Encrypted message storage and retrieval
- **Conversation Switching**: Seamless switching between conversations
- **Progressive Loading**: Efficient message history loading

## Design Direction

### Updated Security Flow
- **Registration**: Collect details → Generate keys → Send verification email → Redirect to login
- **Verification**: User must click email link before login access is granted
- **Login**: Verify email status → Load user profile → Access dashboard
- **Conversation Flow**: Search users → Create conversation with password → Share access code → Secure messaging

### Visual Updates
- **Removed Elements**: Animated lock icon from loading and registration panels (replaced with chat icon)
- **Security Indicators**: Clear 2048-bit encryption badges and status indicators
- **Conversation UI**: Focus on conversation management vs. simple contact lists
- **Access Code Sharing**: Visual emphasis on secure code sharing and joining flows

### Enhanced Database Schema Compliance
- **User Management**: Full compliance with users table structure
- **Security Tracking**: Integration with login_sessions, security_alerts tables
- **Message Encryption**: Proper encryption_metadata storage and retrieval
- **Status Management**: Real-time status updates and last_seen tracking

## Implementation Considerations

### Email Verification System
- **Verification Flow**: Registration sends verification email → User clicks link → Account activated
- **Login Protection**: Prevent login until email is verified
- **Resend Mechanism**: Allow users to request new verification emails
- **Verification Status**: Track email_confirmed_at timestamp

### 2048-bit Cryptography
- **Key Generation**: True 2048-bit RSA key generation with secure random
- **Encryption Process**: Multi-phase encryption with progress indicators
- **Storage Security**: Keys stored locally, public keys in database
- **Performance**: Maintain 3-minute encryption time for security demonstration

### Database Security & Performance
- **Row Level Security**: Ensure users can only access their conversations
- **Encrypted Storage**: All message content encrypted before database insertion
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimized conversation and message retrieval
- **Real-time Subscriptions**: Live updates for active conversations

### Scalability & Production Readiness
- **User Search**: Efficient user discovery with indexed username/display_name
- **Conversation Management**: Support for multiple simultaneous conversations
- **Message History**: Paginated message loading for performance
- **Session Management**: Proper session cleanup and security monitoring

## Reflection
- This implementation prioritizes verified, traceable communications over anonymous messaging
- The email verification requirement establishes user accountability while maintaining privacy
- 2048-bit encryption provides genuine security while the computational delay demonstrates commitment
- Conversation access codes create secure, invitation-only communication spaces
- Full database integration ensures production-ready scalability and proper data management
