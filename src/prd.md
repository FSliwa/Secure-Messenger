## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: Trust, Security, Professionalism with approachable warmth
**Design Personality**: Clean, modern, minimalist with subtle security cues
**Visual Metaphors**: Lock icons, shields, encrypted data flows
**Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface that doesn't compromise on functionality

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Analogous with security-focused blues and greens
**Primary Color**: Deep Blue (#1e40af) - Trust and security
**Secondary Colors**: Light grays and whites for clean backgrounds
**Accent Color**: Secure Green (#10b981) - Success and verification states
**Color Psychology**: Blues convey trust and security, greens indicate success and safety
**Color Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliant with 4.5:1+ contrast ratios

**Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headers (600-700), body (400), and captions (400)
**Font Personality**: Professional, clean, highly legible
**Readability Focus**: Optimal line height (1.5), comfortable font sizes (16px+ for body)
**Which fonts**: Inter from Google Fonts
**Legibility Check**: Inter is optimized for screen reading and accessibility

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Security indicators and primary actions emphasized
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing for calm, professional feel
**Grid System**: Consistent 8px grid system for perfect alignment
**Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first design with progressive enhancement
**Content Density**: Balanced - not overwhelming but information-rich when needed

### Animations
