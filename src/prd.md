- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Clean minimal interface with progressive disclosure of advanced features

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with security-focused accents
- **Primary Color**: Deep professional blue (Facebook-inspired but more serious) - communicates trust and security
- **Secondary Colors**: Secure grays and whites for readability
- **Accent Color**: Encrypted green for security confirmations, warning amber for caution states
- **Color Psychology**: Blues for trust and security, greens for verified/secure states, reds for threats
- **Color Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliant with 4.5:1+ contrast ratios
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (light blue-gray) + Foreground (dark blue-gray): 12.3:1 contrast
  - Card (white) + Card-foreground (dark blue-gray): 13.1:1 contrast
  - Primary (blue) + Primary-foreground (white): 8.7:1 contrast
  - Secondary (light gray) + Secondary-foreground (dark gray): 9.2:1 contrast

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with varied weights for hierarchy
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Bold headers, medium navigation, regular body text, light metadata
- **Font Personality**: Professional, readable, trustworthy, modern
- **Readability Focus**: 16px minimum, 1.5 line height, 60-80 character line length
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent spacing using 8px grid system
- **Which fonts**: Inter (Google Fonts) - excellent for interfaces and high readability
- **Legibility Check**: Inter passes all accessibility standards with excellent screen rendering

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Security indicators first, then active conversations, then messaging tools
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing to create calm, focused environment for secure communications
- **Grid System**: 8px base grid with 16px component spacing for visual rhythm
- **Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first with progressive enhancement for desktop
- **Content Density**: Balanced - not cluttered but information-rich for power users

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Encryption progress indicators, security confirmations, smooth transitions
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Critical security states > message sending > navigation transitions
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Subtle professional animations that don't distract from security focus

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Cards for conversations, Dialogs for encryption setup, Forms for secure input
- **Component Customization**: Enhanced security indicators, encryption progress bars, biometric prompts
- **Component States**: Clear visual feedback for encrypted/unencrypted states
- **Icon Selection**: Lock, shield, check-circle for security states; send, more-horizontal for actions
- **Component Hierarchy**: Security indicators primary, messaging secondary, settings tertiary
- **Spacing System**: 8px base unit with 16px, 24px, 32px for larger components
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Touch-friendly controls, swipe gestures, bottom navigation

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based with security-first design tokens
