## Date: October 8, 2025

### Testing Summary

3. **Conversations** - Creation, joining, permissions checked
4. **Security Features** - 2FA, biometrics, account lockout mechanisms tested
5. **UI/UX** - Responsiveness, dark mode, accessibility verified

### Applied Fixes

2. **Voice Recording**: Added MediaRecorder API implementation
3. **Email System**: Created helper functions for Supabase Auth
4. **RLS Policies**: Previously fixed with SECURITY DEFINER functions

### GitHub Status

✅ **Repository Updated:**
- All changes pushed to main branch
- No emojis used in commit messages as requested
- Repository: https://github.com/FSliwa/Secure-Messenger

### Server Deployment

⚠️ **Partial Success:**
- Application is still running (HTTP 200 OK)
- Old version remains active on http://5.22.223.49
- New Docker build failing due to platform-specific dependencies

### Build Issues

The Docker build is failing due to Alpine Linux platform-specific module issues:
1. lightningcss - Fixed ✓
2. @tailwindcss/oxide - Fixed ✓  
3. @swc/core - Still failing ✗

### Current Application Status

Despite build failures, the application on the server is:
- ✅ Accessible at http://5.22.223.49
- ✅ Responding with HTTP 200
- ✅ Running previous stable version
- ⚠️ Not updated with latest fixes yet

### Recommendations

1. **For Immediate Use**: The application is functional with the previous version
2. **For Latest Features**: Consider using Vercel or simpler deployment without Docker
3. **Alternative**: Build locally and transfer built files to server

### Manual Update Option

If you need the latest version immediately, you can:
1. Build locally: `npm run build`
2. Transfer dist folder to server
3. Serve with nginx directly

The core functionality improvements (encryption, voice, email) are ready in the codebase and will be available once the deployment issue is resolved.
